#By doing strace we see a call to access then a call to open functions, we can exploit this timeframe to change the name of the file token to trick the program:

level10@SnowCrash:~$ python server.py
#Then we switch ln targets and hope that the program will execute at the moment the Time Of Check is over and the Time Of Use has not started.
#The target will alternate real fast between a file we own /tmp/test2 and the file we want /home/user/level10/token
